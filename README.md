The objective of this project is to identify switch genes in Prostate adenocarcinoma gene expression data from the TCGA database by using 
In complex network analysis, switch genes are hubs that are not only characterized by a
marked negative correlation with their first nearest neighbors, but also distinguished by an
unusual pattern of intra- and inter-module connections that gives them a crucial topological role,
interestingly mirrored by the evidence of their clinic-biological relevance. In fact, the switch
genes were found in all cancers studied by Paci et al., 2017 and they encompass protein
coding genes and non-coding RNAs, recovering many known key cancer players but also many
new potential biomarkers not yet characterized in cancer context. Given the importance of these
switch genes, the objective of this project is to identify switch genes in Prostate adenocarcinoma
gene expression data from the TCGA database. To reach the goal, using the SWIMmeR
package, the data is filtered, the networks are found from that data and from those networks
switch genes are found. As a final step, resilience analysis is executed. The ultimate acquired
genes could be investigated for further research in Prostate adenocarcinoma
